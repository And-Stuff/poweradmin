CHANGES between revision 61 and orginal 1.2.7-patched
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Removed a few bugs in the 1.3.0 release.

- Moved language setting to config file.

- Added support for all PowerDNS zone types: slave, master and native.

- Added support for supermasters.

- Added basic support for skins. All html markup tags are now removed
  from the code. One example CSS file has been added. The CSS and HTML
  has been made as flexible as possible, so one is free to position a
  menu in a left bar instead of inline with other elements, etc.

- Changed all visible occurrences of "domain" to "zone".

- Updated i18n related files, Dutch translation fully updated.

- Added a page with credits to the original authors.

- Removed all PHP shorttags.

- Updated the "database abstraction layer" from an outdated version of
  the unmaintained PEAR::DB module to the most recent version of
  PEAR::MDB2 (which is currently 2.4.0). Please read the README file
  for important information about upgrading from 1.2.7-patched. It
  will not break anything if you don't, but it won't work either. :)

- Added multi-language support, using php's gettext functionality. A 
  first Dutch translation has been added, along with English. See for
  more details docs/README.i18n.

- Removed the so-called "sequence updater". The code has been changed
  to use the auto increment functionalitiy in both mysql and pgsql. It 
  is only tested on these backends, other backends are untested and
  may be unsupported. See docs/README.sequence for more details on
  inserting records and zones into the powerdns database when using
  other tools than poweradmin as well.

- Fixed a bug in search.php. When searching for a string it would
  return matching records, not the matching domains.

- Started cleanup code and files. For example, remove code and files
  related to "migration from a stone-age version of poweradmin",
  removal of the file called "BAKrecords.php", removal of code
  comments of already implemented todo's, etc.

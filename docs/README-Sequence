1. What is the Sequence Updater
-------------------------------

The Sequence updater is written to synchronize your PowerAdmin/DNS database 
after you have manually inserted records into it. 

2. Why do I need that?
-------------------------------

Because PowerAdmin uses the php-PEAR::DB library it is using sequence numbers. 
A sequence number simply tells the application what will be the next ID 
for insertion. Some of the mysql users are now shouting auto_increment.
Yes auto_increment, but we cant use this here because we plan to use 
PostGreSQL or Other db's that dont have auto_increment so we are stuck to
using sequence numbers.

3. What does this mean?
-------------------------------

This means that if you dont run this tool after you have been manually adding
records, your database might be corrupted and PowerAdmin might be kicking
you back with a lot of errors.

4. Ok, I got it, now what?
-------------------------------

Put this file in your PowerAdmin directory. Login into PowerAdmin using the normal
system. Now go to the url where you put it and done, the sequence numbers are
updated.

5. Future versions
-------------------------------

In all versions higher than 1.1.2 this function will be automatically there for
administrators.

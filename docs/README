What is PowerAdmin?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The project's purpose is to create and maintain a friendly web-based DNS
administration tool for the PowerDNS DNS server. The most recent version
has full support for all zone types, support for supermasters, multi-
language support and more.

See <https://code.krikkit.nl/trac/poweradmin/wiki/Features> for a list
of features.

The original PowerAdmin code was written by Trancer and Sjeemz. This
version ("a complete(r) PowerAdmin) is an adaption by Rejo Zenger. Many
people have contributed to the current code. For a list of contributors,
please see <https://code.krikkit.nl/trac/poweradmin/wiki/Credits>.


Where to get PowerAdmin?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

At <https://code.krikkit.nl/trac/poweradmin> you can download the most
recent version. 


Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- PowerDNS, versions 2.1 through 2.9.19 have been tested, others might
  work as well. See <http://www.powerdns.com>.

- MySQL or PostgreSQL. Both MySQL versions 4 and 5 have been reported
  to work, 5.0.22 has been tested.
  
- A webserver that support PHP 4 or 5. Apache 2.0.55 has been tested.

- PHP. At least version 4.2.1. Version 5.1.2 has been tested. It needs
  the mysql or pgsql extension, as well has PEAR. 

- PEAR::MDB2 (2.4.0 has been tested) and PEAR::MDB2_Driver_mysql
  (1.4.0 has been tested) or PEAR::MDB2_Driver_pgsql.


Installing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Upgrading? See section "Upgrading". 

- Install PowerDNS with a mysql or pgsql backend.

- Install MDB2 and MDB2_Driver_mysql (or pgsql equivalent) packages of
  PEAR. You can install PEAR on a Debian-based server by installing
  the package php-pear. Make sure php-cli can access the mysql module
  (uncomment the line "extension=mysql.so" in /etc/php5/cli/php.ini).
  The additional PEAR packages can be installed using the "pear 
  install" command.

- Add a SQL user for poweradmin that is granted SELECT, INSERT,
  DELETE, UPDATE and CREATE actions.

- Untar and gunzip the poweradmin package in your web dir. This will
  create a directory "poweradmin-VERSION", we will refer to this
  directory as "poweradmin/".

- In the 'poweradmin/inc" directory the file "config-me.inc.php".
  Edit this file to suit your environment. Then rename this file to
  config.inc.php to be able to load the site. The website will not
  work properly without a config, so pay attention to your config!

- Next, go to <http://yourserver/poweradmin/install.php>

- Fill in the required information to make an administrator login for
  your PowerAdmin. If all goes well, the user is added, and you can
  log in using that username. Do not forget to remove install.php from
  the webdir!

- Finaly, run <http://yourserver/poweradmin/test_setup.php> to see if
  everything is setup correctly. This test also includes the
  functionality testing of your PowerDNS records (whether you
  have read/write access or not).


Upgrading from 1.2.7-patched
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are upgrading from 1.2.7-patched, there is not much you need to
do. The only thing that is needed is install PEAR packages MDB2 and
MDB2_Driver_mysql (or MDB2_Driver_pgsql). This can be done by running
the commands "pear install MDB2 ; pear install MDB2_Driver_mysql".
Make sure php-cli can access the mysql extension by uncommenting the
line "extension=mysql.so" in /etc/php5/cli/php.ini
